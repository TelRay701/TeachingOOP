Object-oriented programming has some keyword members that are used throughout the course of TypeScript. The key members that I will be explaining are ‘static’, ‘protected’, and ‘private’. These 3 keywords are used to restrict properties and methods' visibility and accessibility. A STATIC member is a member of a class that belongs to the class itself, meaning that we cannot access those properties from an instance of the class.We can only access the properties directly by referencing the class itself. This is good for when you want to re-use the functionality of a class without the need of instantiating the class.

A PROTECTED member is a member of a class whose method or property is accessible only internally within the class or any class that extends it but not externally. A good use case for this is when you have multiple members and want to outline common behaviors amongst them but not shown outside to the external code. A PRIVATE member is a member of a class that can only be accessed or called from the class instance itself. You can use this when you want to prevent particular details that lie internally from showing in the external portion of your code, or when you don’t want any external code modifying the state of the object.

These keywords help you create more robust, maintainable code by controlling the visibility and accessibility of class members, as well as encapsulating, reusing, and promoting code reuse.
